# Indentation and spacing
indent_size = 2  #Recommended by default, but it can be overwritten by rules below (depending on file extension).
indent_style = space  #Spaces instead of tabs, as different code readors (e.g., online git code comparers) interprent tabs with different indent.

# New line preferences
end_of_line = crlf
insert_final_newline = true:error  #Git doesn't like, when file is not ended with space.
trim_trailing_whitespace = true:error  #Trailing whitespaces complicate work with code in text editor and git.

# Xml files
[*.{xml,xaml,config,aspx,cshtml,html}]
indent_size = 2  #Recommended as industry standard. Xml files have deep nesting, so small indent is important.

# C# files
[*.cs]
indent_size = 4  #Recommended as industry standard. Allowed to be replaced to 2. Not so important, as modern C# code-style recommends to break long lines.
